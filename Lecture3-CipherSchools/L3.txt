In this lecture, I studied the concepts of frontend and backend development and their interactions. 
The frontend connects with the backend, and the backend communicates with the database. 
There can be multiple backends and servers.

For the frontend, we study:
- React

For the backend, we study:
- Node.js
- Express

For the database, we study:
- MongoDB
